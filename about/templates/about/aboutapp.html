                    Django Weather Services (DWS) was founded in 2021, by a group of university students looking to future proof themselves. They went about his by learning how to code in Python. Django, a high-level Python based framework, was developed around three core principles: ridiculously fast, reassuringly secure, and exceedingly scalable. Utilizing Djangoâ€™s API modules, DWS pulls all weather data from OpenWeatherMap, which provides current and future weather forecasts for over 200,000 cities across the globe.
